There are several apps available that can analyze a song and provide you with the piano notes or sheet music. One popular app is AnthemScore, which can generate sheet music from audio files in various formats. 
Similarly, apps like Note Recognition and Audio to Sheet Music can also convert music into notes. Keep in mind that the accuracy of such apps can vary depending on the complexity of the music and the quality of the audio file. 
Make sure to check the app's compatibility with your device and read user reviews to find the best fit for your needs.
